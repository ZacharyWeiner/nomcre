           <p style="text-align:justify">The Nomcre way is more than just a set of rules. It’s an understanding that we adhere to in order to deliver the best result for the client in an awesome and creative way.
            The next phase of The Nomcre Way comes into how we deal with editing. All of her editing is done off site and it is centralized which means when the creator creates and uploads, we start editing. Sometimes this even happens while they’re sleeping. This allows us to create with consistency that will make your brand stand out. It also allows the client to come back and take existing assets to re-edit and make them relevant when their strategy or visual identity happens to shift</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">The best part is the client only has contact in the points where it is required. There are no endless meetings. There are no board rooms or conference calls with 15 people.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Part of The Nomcre Way starts with how we have boiled down the creative brief to make it work for the client, and not be tedious for either the creators or the client. The Nomcre Way is also global. Our shooters, editors, and  directors always are on call around the planet.  We can convey the creative intent, look feel, and brand positioning of any clients, at anytime. You can free yourself from the confines of how you thought it needed to be done, because pricing jobs out there with agencies is wasteful and sometimes on unattainable. </p>
